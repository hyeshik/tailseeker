# Tailseeker 3.1

>_**(CAUTION)** The current version tailseeker 3 fails to process many of HiSeq- and MiSeq-derived data due to a problem in the normalization parameter estimation. It is highly recommended to validate whether the length measurements were done correctly using the QC outputs in `qcplots/*.pdf`. In the case with apparent errors, it is advised to try [an older version](https://github.com/hyeshik/tailseeker/tree/tailseeker2) instead, which is relatively insensitive than tailseeker 3. The issue originates from the patterned imbalance of fluorescence signals among the channels. An additional locally adaptive normalization step before the processing would be required to fix this. There's currently no progression on the implementation from the authors as they don't have a project using this recently. Please consider opening a pull request once you write one._

Tailseeker is the official pipeline for TAIL-seq, which measures poly(A) tail
lengths and 3′-end modifications with Illumina SBS sequencers.

# Analysis levels

Users can choose the extent of analysis by Tailseeker to let Tailseeker do
almost everything, or just minimal tail length measurement. The options and
the list of supported genomes are as followed:

| Level | Genomes | Features |
| ----- | ------- | -------- |
| 1 | Any | Poly(A) length measurement (≥ 5nt)<br>Non-A additions to poly(A) tails<br>PCR duplicate removal<br>Quality check for poly(A) length measurement |
| 2 | BDGP6 *(D. melanogaster)*<br>JGIxl91 *(Xenopus laevis)* | All features from level 1<br>Poly(A) length refinement based on genome sequence<br>Non-templated 3′-end tails<br>Alignments to genome (BAM) |
| 3 | GRCh38 *(Homo sapiens)*<br>GRCm38 *(Mus musculus)*<br>GRCz10 *(Danio rerio)*<br>WBcel235 *(C. elegans)*<br>Rnor\_6.0 *(Rattus norvegicus)* | All features from level 2<br>Gene-level statistics for poly(A) length and non-templated additions<br>Gene-level quantifications |


# Running with Conda

Conda is the most convenient way to install `tailseeker`. The current
`tailseeker` version depends on old versions of several programs.
You can install them without a significant effort in an isolated
environment. Try this command:

    conda create -n tailseeker -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c qbio tailseeker

As soon as the installation finishes you can use it like this:

    conda activate tailseeker

    tseek

You need a reference annotation database for level 2 or 3 analyses.
Downloaded databases can be took up by tailseeker if you specify the
path in `TAILSEEKER_REFDIR`.

# Running with Docker

If you have a host running [Docker](https://www.docker.com), you can run
the tailseeker pipeline without installing any. For Apple macOS or
Microsoft Windows users, this is the only easy way to run tailseeker
without extensive effort. The current image is not ready for running
it on multi-node HPC clusters. For those environments, you're encouraged
to install the software in
[conventional way as described later](#non-docker-installations).

Download the image and a wrapper script:

    docker pull hyeshik/tailseeker:latest

    curl -L http://bit.ly/tseek-docker > tseek
    chmod 755 tseek

Prepare a project configuration on
[this page](http://hyeshik.github.io/tailseeker/generate-settings.html).
Fill `/data` in “Data dir.” instead of the original paths.

Set the environment variables up:

    # Point the directory holding the raw data from an Illumina sequencer
    export TAILSEEKER_DATADIR=/storage/150922_M01178_0123_00000000-ACB72

    # Create an empty directory for new temporary and output files
    mkdir myproject    # replace myproject with your favorite name
    cd myproject
    cat > tailseeker.yaml
    # and paste the content generated from the settings web page.
    # Press Ctrl-D.

Run the pipeline:

    ../tseek -j

Then, the results will be located in the current directory.

When you run an analysis with references to the genome (level 2 and 3),
you need to extend the Docker image to supplement a genome reference
database. Build the Docker image from an empty directory like this:

    curl -L http://bit.ly/Dockerfile-withref > Dockerfile
    docker build -t tailseeker:GRCz10 --build-arg genome=GRCz10 .

Then, you'll need to define an environment variable before running
`tseek` to use your own Docker image.

    export TAILSEEKER_IMAGE=tailseeker:GRCz10


# Non-Docker installations

## Installing tailseeker

You can install *tailseeker* from either a source distribution or a binary package.
The binary package includes many of pre-compiled external programs that were built on
a x64 Linux box with Ubuntu 16.04. For the other environments, it is recommended to
use the source package to install it.

### Installing from a full binary bundle

Download a tarball from the [download section](https://github.com/hyeshik/tailseeker/releases).
Extract the files into an appropriate place inside your filesystem.

    wget {the download URL}
    tar -xzf tailseeker-3.x.x-bundle-ubuntu_xenial.tar.gz
    cd tailseeker-3.x.x-bundle-ubuntu_xenial

Install Python modules that are used in tailseeker using `pip`.

    pip3 install --user --upgrade --requirement install/requirements.txt

Add the `bin/` subdirectory of the tailseeker top directory to your `PATH`. To continue
using tailseeker later, you will need to add this to a shell startup script such as
`.bashrc` or `.zshrc` according to your login shell.

    export PATH="{PATH_TO}/tailseeker-3.x.x-bundle-ubuntu_xenial/bin:$PATH"

Now, you can invoke the tailseeker pipeline with `tseek` command from anywhere. Proceed to
[generate the genome reference database](#generating-genome-reference-databases).

### Installing from a source package

#### Prerequisite software

Here're the list of software that must be installed before using tailseeker.

  * Essential dependencies
    * Python 3.3 or higher
    * pkg-config
    * bash
    * wget
    * make and a C compilation toolchain
    * whiptail
    * [htslib](http://www.htslib.org) – `htslib` depends on `zlib` 1.2.4 or later. If you are using an old system released before 2010, you may need to upgrade `zlib` first.
    * Python packages that can be easily installed using `pip` (see below)
      * [Snakemake](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Home) - 3.5 or higher

  * Optional for more sensitive analysis
    * [All Your Bases](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/goldman-srv/AYB/) - requires
      [my patch](https://github.com/hyeshik/AYB2) to work with the recent Illumina
      sequencers.
    * [GSNAP](http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/)

The toolchains and generic command line utilities can be installed if
you're an administrator on a Debian or Ubuntu system:

    sudo apt install whiptail pkg-config gcc wget make

You can install the Python modules in the list with this command from the
top source directory:

    pip3 install --user -r install/requirements.txt


#### Installation

A script in the top directory will check the paths of prerequisite tools and 
guide you to set configurations correctly. Please run:

    ./setup.sh

Proceed to [generate the genome reference database](#generating-genome-reference-databases).


## Running the pipeline

### Generating genome reference databases

First of all, build reference databases unless you're going to run `tailseeker` in
genome-independent mode, or the level 1 analysis.

    cd {tailseeker home}/refdb/level2 && snakemake -j -- {genome}
    cd {tailseeker home}/refdb/level3 && snakemake -j -- {genome}

Type the identifier of the genome to be used in place of `{genome}`. List of
the available genomes are shown in the first section of this tutorial.

### Running the pipeline

  1. Copy the full output hierarchy from MiSeq or HiSeq to somewhere in
     your machine.
  2. Create an empty work directory. This is used for storing the final result
     files and the intermediate files which you may want to look into when
     something went wrong.
  3. Prepare a settings file on
     [this page](http://hyeshik.github.io/tailseeker/generate-settings.html). Paste the
     content into a new file `tailseeker.yaml` inside the work directory.
  4. Run the pipeline with one of these commands:
 
     ```sh
     # In case you have an access to a job queuing system of a cluster. Change 150 to the
     # maximum number of jobs that you can put into the queue at a time.
     tseek -c qsub -j 150

     # In case you have a single multi-core machine,
     tseek -j
     ```

     All [Snakemake options](https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Documentation#markdown-header-all-options)
     can be used in `tseek`, too.

  5. Take a look at the `qcplots/` on the work directory. The plots there show how
     poly(A) length calling was accurate.

  6. Perform the downstream analyses using the output files.


# Pre-built genome resource packages

Instead of building a resource database by yourself, you can download one of the
pre-built packages that are updated from time to time. Here're are the pointers
for those files.

# Data outputs

## Read name format (analysis level 1 only)

In an analysis level 1 output, FASTQ files are fulfilled with nucleotide
sequences, quality scores as well as poly(A) tail information in read name.
For the higher analysis levels, read names only include minimal identifiers.
Use `refined-taginfo/*.txt.gz` for tailing status of each read this case.

FASTQ files are located in `fastq/` in the level 1 analysis. It will contain
`_R5.fastq.gz` and `_R3.fastq.gz` files for each sample. `_R5` includes
the sequences from the 5′-end of the RNA fragments, which is generally
sequenced by read 1. `_R3` is from the other end.
     
Each sequence entry has the identifier names in the following structure:

    ```
    (1)   (2)      (3) (4) (5)(6)
    a1101:00003863:0012:17:10:TT
    
    (1) Tile number with an internal lane identifier.
    (2) Serial number of the sequence, which is unique in the tile.
    (3) Flags in hexadecimal representing data processing procedure of the read.
    (4) Length of poly(A) tail.
    (5) Length of additions modifications to poly(A).
    (6) Post-poly(A) nucleotide additions.
    ```

Flags on the third field are encoded by combinations of the following bits:

| Bit (decimal) | Bit (hexadecimal) | Description |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
|       1       |      0x0001       | A poly(A) tail is detected |
|       2       |      0x0002       | Delimiter sequence is matched with one or more mismatch |
|       4       |      0x0004       | Have a post-poly(A) modification |
|       8       |      0x0008       | Poly(A) length is measured using fluorescence signal |
|      16       |      0x0010       | Index sequence is matched to a sample with one or more mismatches |
|      32       |      0x0020       | Delimiter sequence is found at a shifted position |
|      64       |      0x0040       | One or more cycle in 3′-read are dark (no fluorescence signal) |
|     128       |      0x0080       | Delimiter sequence is not found |
|     256       |      0x0100       | Basecalling quality of balancer region is bad |
|     512       |      0x0200       | Nucleotide composition of balancer region is biased |
|    1024       |      0x0400       | Fluorescence signal in balancer region is irregular or too dark |
|    2048       |      0x0800       | Number of dark cycle in read 2 exceeds the threshold |
|    4096       |      0x1000       | (level 2) 5′-read and 3′-read are aligned to two very distant positions in the genome |
|    8192       |      0x2000       | (level 2) 3′-read is aligned to a position adjacent to an expected polyadenylation site |
